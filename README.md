# VSCode Auto Deploy
If you use VSCode for Salesforce development, it needs to: 
1. save the file 
2. right-click 
3. choose the option to "Deploy to Org" to see the changes in Salesforce.

This tool contains Salesforce DX which deploys code changes from local to Salesforce automatically by save the file or ctrl+s. </p>
